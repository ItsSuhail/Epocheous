# Epocheous

Epocheous is a simple chat app following a unique idea.

The concept is simple, a date corresponds to a chat room, you may enter 3rd April 2008, or 10th February 2026.

The identity tags are transformed into a unique hash, so you would know you are chatting with the same person you were chatting yesterday (say) as a hash uniquely corresponds to an identity tag.

+ No encryption
+ History never gets deleted
+ 100% Anonymity
+ Could be used if you really want to use a chat app to communicate
